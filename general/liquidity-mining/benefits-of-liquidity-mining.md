# Benefits of Liquidity Mining

Since the relationship between the DEX, liquidity pools, and liquidity providers is symbiotic, liquidity mining benefits all parties involved. Some of the benefits include:

* LPs earn rewards: Liquidity mining rewards liquidity providers with a yield similar to staking. The process is autonomous and on-chain, ensuring equal distribution of rewards.&#x20;
* Decision-making rights: Since the rewards are in the protocolâ€™s native token, holders gain voting rights within the ecosystem.
