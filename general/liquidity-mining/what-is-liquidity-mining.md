# What Is Liquidity Mining?

Liquidity mining refers to injecting funds (in the form of digital assets) into liquidity pools, providing decentralized exchanges with liquidity to earn rewards.&#x20;

DeFi users injecting funds into liquidity pools are called liquidity providers (LPs). Typically, they deposit two tokens into a decentralized trading pool to earn a share of the poolâ€™s trading fees, plus protocol tokens paid out as incentives to LPs to provide liquidity.

Liquidity mining is enabled by decentralized exchanges that deploy [automated market makers (AMMs)](https://unchainedcrypto.com/what-is-automated-market-maker/), enabling LPs to contribute liquidity into a decentralized trading smart contract to allow traders to buy and sell the (usually) two tokens held in the trading pool directly from and to the smart contract.&#x20;
